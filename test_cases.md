### Test Case 1: Create Entity
**Objective**: Verify that the API can create a new entity.
**Input**: 
```json
{
  "Addresses": [
    {
      "AddressLine": "742 Evergreen Terrace",
      "City": "Springfield",
      "Country": "USA"
    }
  ],
  "Dates": [
    {
      "DateType": "Birth",
      "Date": "1985-05-12T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "Deceased": false,
  "Gender": "Male",
  "Id": "ent-1001",
  "Names": [
    {
      "FirstName": "Homer",
      "MiddleName": "J",
      "Surname": "Simpson"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Output**: A `201 Created` response with the created entity's details, including a unique `Id`.

### Test Case 2: Read Entity
**Objective**: Verify that the API can retrieve an existing entity by ID.
**Input**: `GET /api/entities/ent-1001`
**Output**: A `200 OK` response with the entity's details if the entity exists.

### Test Case 3: Update Entity
**Objective**: Verify that the API can update an existing entity.
**Input**: 
```json
{
  "Addresses": [
    {
      "AddressLine": "123 Fake Street",
      "City": "Shelbyville",
      "Country": "USA"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Output**: A `200 OK` response with the updated entity's details.

### Test Case 4: Delete Entity
**Objective**: Verify that the API can delete an existing entity.
**Input**: `DELETE /api/entities/ent-1001`
**Output**: A `204 No Content` response indicating successful deletion.

### Test Case 5: List Entities
**Objective**: Verify that the API can list all entities.
**Input**: `GET /api/entities`
**Output**: A `200 OK` response with a list of entities.

### Test Case 6: Search Entities
**Objective**: Verify that the API supports searching entities by name.
**Input**: `GET /api/entities?search=Homer`
**Output**: A `200 OK` response with a list of entities matching the search criteria.

### Test Case 7: Filter Entities
**Objective**: Verify that the API supports filtering entities by gender.
**Input**: `GET /api/entities?gender=Male`
**Output**: A `200 OK` response with a list of entities matching the filter criteria.

### Test Case 8: Retry and Backoff Mechanism
**Objective**: Ensure the API retries with backoff after a transient failure during a `POST` operation.
**Condition**: A transient database error occurs during the operation.
**Input**: 
```json
{
  "Addresses": [
    {
      "AddressLine": "123 Maple Street",
      "City": "Newtown",
      "Country": "Freedonia"
    }
  ],
  "Dates": [
    {
      "DateType": "Birth",
      "Date": "1990-07-15T00:00:00Z"
    }
  ],
  "Deceased": false,
  "Gender": "Non-Binary",
  "Id": "entity-12345",
  "Names": [
    {
      "FirstName": "Alex",
      "MiddleName": "J.",
      "Surname": "Doe"
    }
  ]
}
```
**Output**: The API logs retry attempts and either successfully creates the entity after retries or fails with an error message after the maximum retries.

**Logs on Successful Creation**:
```
Info: Attempting to create entity...
Warning: Transient error encountered. Retrying in 2 seconds.
Info: Attempting to create entity...
Info: Entity created successfully on retry 2.
```

**Logs on Failed Creation**:
```
Info: Attempting to create entity...
Warning: Transient error encountered. Retrying in 2 seconds.
Info: Attempting to create entity...
Warning: Transient error encountered. Retrying in 4 seconds.
Info: Attempting to create entity...
Error: Maximum retry attempts reached. Operation failed.
```

## Conclusion
These test cases ensure that the basic CRUD operations and search/filter functionalities are working as expected. They should be executed as part of the API's testing suite to maintain quality and reliability.

## Test Case Format Explanation

The test cases in this document are structured to focus on the expected behavior of the API in response to specific conditions. For instance, in the case of transient errors, the test case describes the condition (a transient error occurring), the input (a sample JSON object sent to the API), and the expected output (the API's behavior, as represented by log entries). This format ensures clarity and consistency across all test cases.
